        <h3>WHAT WE DO TO HELP</h3>
        <p>
          We connect with the small-scale farmers of various regions and help
          them to make their farming practices environment-friendly. To cope
          with the stubble burning issue, we assign machinery as well as
          volunteers to the needy farmers of the specific area for the required
          duration of time according to the size of the farming lands.

          <h3>Super-straw management system</h3>
          <p>
            An equipment attached with the Combined Harvester (a machine that is
            used to combine four separate harvesting operations- reaping,
            threshing, gathering and winnowing â€“ to a single process) so it cut
            standing stubble in small pieces and spreads it on the soil surface.

          <h3>Smart seeder</h3>
          <p>
            Smart seeder: It manages paddy residue by incorporation and surface
            mulching hence retaining the benefits of both; the happy seeder
            (sows seeds directly in rows without any prior seedbed preparation)
            and the super seeder (extensively used for planting a wide variety
            of seeds).

          <h3>Paddy-straw chopper</h3>
          <p>
            It chops the paddy stalks into small pieces which are spread over
            the field which later mixes into the soil of the field it becomes
            organic fertilizer which is very useful for soil.

          <h3>Reversible plough</h3>
          <p>
            It is used for initial soil preparation for sowing seed or planting.
            Generally used for deep tillage of land, to help turn over the upper
            layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while
            buying weeds and remains of previous crop.

          <h3>Baler</h3>
          <p>
            When used as a tractor attachment, a baler turns agricultural
            leftovers, such as hay and flax straws, into bales that can then be
            utilized for a variety of things, including haylage and animal feed.

        <h3>OTHER ACTIVITIES: USAGE OF CHEMICALS</h3>
        <p>
          1. Pesticides are applied to agricultural land to control pests which
          hamper crop growth. Soil contamination occurs when pesticides
          accumulate in soils, which alter microbial processes, increase plant
          uptake of the chemical, and are toxic to soil organisms. They can also
          accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms.
          In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects,
          such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests than they are to
          the target pests themselves.
          <br />
          2. Pesticide leaching occurs when pesticides mix with water and move
          through the soil, ultimately contaminating groundwater. Leaching is
          most likely to happen if using a water-soluble pesticide and if
          excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application. Leaching
          may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide
          mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or
          disposal areas.
          <br />
          3. Fertilizers are used to provide crops with additional sources of
          nutrients, such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, that promote
          plant growth and increase crop yields. While they are beneficial for
          plant growth, they can also disrupt natural nutrient and mineral
          biogeochemical cycles and pose risks to human and ecological health.

        <h3>We also provide</h3>
        <p>
          organic fertilizers and pesticides to the farmers as they are a better
          option for environment-friendly farming
          <br />
          Improved airy soil structure
          <br />
          Healthier soil and more fertile
          <br />
          Longer period available for crops than chemical fertilizers
